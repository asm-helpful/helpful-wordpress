# Helpful Wordpress

Idea from @jeffreynolte:

> I feel like this is the type of tool that would work really well as a wordpress plugin. In addition to being a useful tool to developers / users trying to implement this type of service it would be a nice way to get additional exposure for the app via the plugin repository. I would be into assisting with the development for this. Maybe it can plugin with a simple api or activation key for premium accounts?
